# Create a Pokemon Catalogue
## Sort and view a list of Pokémon from one or several generations

## Summary
This program allows you to select from Generations 1-9 to select which Pokémon will be added to your Catalogue.
From here, you will (not yet implemented) be able to view your Pokemon sorted numerically, alphabetically, and by type.

## Project Status
Currently I am making sure that the Pokemon files are read into the Catalogue correctly.

## How it Works
...Let me get it to work first.

## What I've Learned So Far
- the difference between passing by value and passing by reference
	- Previously I could _describe_ the difference and tell you what it _looked like_ (at least in C++), but I didn't understand it until I used the wrong one and figured out the problem.
- the importance of testing...
	- and coding 'defensively'.. basically not being arrogant.
- how to implement an std::set
- _why_ operator << is often defined outside a class (or as a 'friend' function) but defined in the same class file (if there is one)
	- I mean, I _think_ I do.. (no more arrogance, remember?)
- how to change the colour of text outputted to terminal :)
