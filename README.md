# Usage
This is a catalogue for organising pokemon.
A user will be prompted to input generations they wish to include in their catalogue.
Once they do this, they will be able to sort Pokemon in the catalogue by generation, type, and alphabetical order.
Pokemon from multiple generations can be included.
