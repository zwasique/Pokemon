//Chat GPT prompt for generating Pokemon files: add generation number 
after "generation"
Would you mind listing the first fifteen pokemon in generation in the 
following format:

name; number; generation; type; evolvedForm;


If there is no evolved form, write None please.
Here are some examples:

Lapras; 131; 1; Water/Ice; None;
Slowpoke; 079; 1; Water/Psychic; Slowbro;
